## About the Collection

This is a small portfolio of some of my most recent pieces of writing over the past year and a half. 
Some backstory: I was initally a computer science major who wasted a couple years writing code that I have already forgotten. When my life seemed bleak, I decided to switch my major for my Bachelor's to English and began writing again after a four year hiatus. These are the pieces deemed worthy enough for online publication. I hope to condense them into one book one day, but preferably anonymous. Within this collection are: 

- Nine pieces of creative non-fiction
- A sample of my first novel
- Some pictures for reference
  
I do not permit use of any of the works.
